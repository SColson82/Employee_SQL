# SQL-Challenge - Employee Database: A Mystery in Two Parts

For this challenge, I was presented with a set of tables in CSV format which my employer requested I import for manipulation.

## One employee with the name Foolsday. Really?

It was at this point that I realized I had been fed a set of fake data and was being tested so I decided to really prove my skills. I read the data into Pandas and using Matplotlib I was able to create a couple nice visuals for my new employer.

Alright, I admit that I did enjoy putting on a few finishing touches to prove my caliber. When I presented all of this information to my new boss she had a surprise I hadn't considered. She suggested I check my own employee number...
